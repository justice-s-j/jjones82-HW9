BAIS3300 HW9: Four-page HTML/CSS form with Bootstrap and accessibility features.

## Project Description
This project is a four page survey form built for Digital Product Management (BAIS:3300). In building this project we used HTML5 and CSS3, and enhanced it with bootstrap for styling. We deployed the project on Microsoft Azure. The survery collect basic information from BAIS students. 

### b. What specifically did you do on your assignment that is a best practice for forms? 
When making the form I was trying to make things clear and easy to fill out. Every field has a label so the user knows what information to provie in the blanks. Radio buttons and checkboxes are grouped together inside fieldsets to let the user know what to select from the multiple choice fields or dropdowns. I also used the 'required' attribute on questions that require an answer so the form won't allow people to skip over them. 

The questions flow naturally on their own respecitve pages and also from page to page. It starts by focusing on general background and then moving to more specific academic questions. Navigation buttons like 'next' and 'finish' are used as well so the user knows ho to move forward and finish. There is also an option to return to the beginning after the survey so multiple responses can be recorded. Bootstap helped with spacing, cards, and button styles so the form looks consistent and can be used on any size of screen fitting as needed.  

### c. What specifically did you do to make your web forms accessible to all users?
To make the survey accessible I first making sure all inputs corresponded witht their answer field. I also ttempted adding tooltips with Font Awesone icons to provide extra guidance if someone had any questions about the survey. The layout adjusts with Bootstrap's responsive design so it works on both phones and desktops, and required fields and color contrast also helps satisfy accessilbity standards.I also validated each page against WCAG Level AA to make sure the format would meet accessibiltiy guidelines.
